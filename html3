          Unlike every other Japanese restaurant in America, Kiraku strives to
          deliver a genuine izakaya experience. By emulating the style of a
          modern izakaya popular in Japan, Kiraku hopes to spread the wonders of
          this style of eating to as many people as possible. Opening in July
          2011, Kiraku, which literally means to relax, wishes to ease the
          stress of daily life by providing beer, sake, small plates, and the
          atmosphere to enjoy company and conversation. When you first sit down
          and receive a warm oshibori towel, it will surely refresh your spirits
          and set the tone for your meal.
